******************************* WELCOME TO DISNEY LAND *******************************

The magic is ready and waiting for you at Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park. Disneyland is a theme park in Anaheim, California, which opened in 1955; it is the only one designed and built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney, who came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. Disneyland Park consists of nine themed "lands" and a number of concealed backstage areas, and occupies over 100 acres with the new addition of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway that's coming to Mickeys Toontown in 2022. Adventureland is designed to recreate the feel of an exotic tropical place in a far-off region of the world. "To create a land that would make this dream reality", said Walt Disney, "we pictured ourselves far from civilization, in the remote jungles of Asia and Africa." Attractions include opening day's Jungle Cruise, the Indiana Jones Adventure, and Tarzan's Treehouse, which is a conversion of Swiss Family Treehouse from the Walt Disney film Swiss Family Robinson. Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room which is located at the entrance to Adventureland was the first feature attraction to employ Audio-Animatronics, a computer synchronization of sound and robotics.A 1-Day One Park Per Day Ticket costs $104 per person.
