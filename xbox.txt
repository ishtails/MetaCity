******************************* WELCOME TO XBOX *******************************

Developed by Microsoft, Xbox is a gaming console  where you can find and socialize with people through our wide range of games 
and be part of this behemoth of a community. A key part of the Xbox One experience is Xbox Network. Connecting your system online 
to Xbox Network allows you to buy game downloads and watch videos, share your recorded gameplay videos, use Skype to talk to 
friends and family, keep track of your friends, achievements, and game progress. In addition, you can play multiplayer games 
online with other people. If you want to play games with other people, you will need to subscribe to Xbox Live Gold. This subscription 
level gives you access to members-only deals and discounts on downloadable games, as well as free game downloads each month with the 
Games With Gold program. If you don't want to subscribe you can still use the Xbox Network free service. You won't be able to play games 
with other people or get free games, but all of the other benefits of Xbox Network will be available to you. There are dozens upon dozens 
of video apps that you can use on Xbox Network such as ESPN, UFC, WWE Network, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, and many, many more that you can use 
on Xbox One for no additional fees Subscription fees for individual apps will still apply, but you don't have to pay for Xbox Live Gold on 
top of them just to use an app. The real draw of any game system is the games, of course, and the Xbox One has the best lineup of next-gen 
games available to buy now. Xbox One has fighting, racing, FPS, TPS, sports, platforming, action, adventure, and many more. 

In addition to traditional games from big publishers, Xbox One has a rapidly growing number of independently published indie games that are 
some of the most interesting and innovative games on the market.
