******************************* WELCOME TO MAGICS OF MANKIND ******************************

Magics of Mankind introduces you to some of the best buildings in the world like The Burj Khalifa, 
Leaning Tower of Pisa, Eiffel Tower, Sydney Opera House and so on. Architecture stands so unique from the 
rest of all artistic forms. A building will stand tall and proud for the entire world to see long after
the beauty of the most expensive painting loses its appeal for the eyes. Architecture has a dynamic role to 
play and sustain.
