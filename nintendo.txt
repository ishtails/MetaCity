******************************* WELCOME TO NINTENDO *******************************

Nintendo is an international leader in the interactive entertainment industry, and develops, produces and markets software and hardware. 
Our games and our TV-linked and mobile consoles set the standards in terms of games fun and challenging, family-friendly entertainment. 
The goal of our work is to make people smile. Beyond being machines for playing games, the Switch and the PS4 are completely different experiences. 
Nintendo's option is best for playing a variety of games with traditional or motion controls straight out of the box and is the only one of the two 
to offer a practical portable experience outside your home. Nintendo's impact on society is huge. They revolutionized how people spent their free 
time and how children socialize with friends. Never before the Nintendo had people spent countless hours staring at a screen, playing with a controller. 
Nintendo spawned the idea of true video gaming.
